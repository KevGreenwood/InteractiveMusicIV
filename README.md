My main goal with this mod is to combine the 3 music mods from https://github.com/ClonkAndre into one to make it a more compact mod and better manage music and avoid overlap, in addition to improving and adding new features such as each episode having its own soundtrack for example:
- IV: its most ambient and dark music
- TLAD: rock and metal
- TBOGT: electronic and pop

Of course, it will depend on the user what music to put, but in this way we could make the game more "complete" and current.

I have some knowledge of C#, but it is my first time handling sound libraries, in this case BASS, and creating scripts for GTA IV. I would greatly appreciate the help of all of you to complete this project.

# Collaborate
If you have experience with GTA IV mods, C# scripts or sound libraries like BASS, I invite you to join this project and contribute your knowledge and experience. Together we can create the best music mod for GTA IV.

Thank you for your interest!
